## Folders ## 
**NetworkEquivalence**: this directory contains codes for eight equivalent networks. The used dataset is the breast cancer datatset.<br/>


##  Running Experiments ## 

Please first go to each directory. Each directory consists of two scripts. One is about the network, and the other is the main file.  

```ruby
>> python NetworkEquivalence/NetworkEquivalency_I.py    
>> python NetworkEquivalence/NetworkEquivalency_II.py 
>> python NetworkEquivalence/NetworkEquivalency_III.py 
```
